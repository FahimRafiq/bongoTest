/*Here a video application will be made using Mediaplayer and SurfaceView. SurfaceView will be the holder for the mediaPlayer. There will be 3 buttons: Play, Forward & Rewind in our activity.

class MainActivity needs to extends AppCompatActivity and implement SurfaceHolder.Callback 
	Declare SurfaceView reference called surfaceView;
	Declare MediaPlayer reference called mediaPlayer;

	onCreate() 
		mediaPlayer is initiated calling mediaPlayer.create method where we point it to our video directory.
		
		surfaceView linkied to its Id using findViewById()
		//to keep our mobile screen always on during the video
		surfaceView.setKeepScreenOn(true) is called

		Surfaceholder object holder is instantiated using surfaceView.getHolder()
		holder.addCallback(this)
		Set screen size of surfaceView using holder.setFixedSize method
	
		
		Create Button play and link it to its view using findViewById method
		IF play button is clicked:
			Start mediaPlayer using mediaPlayer.Start()
		ENDIF
	
		Create Button forward and link it to its view using findViewById method
		IF forward button is clicked:
			//fetch the current position of the player and add 10 seconds to it
			forward video using mediaPlayer.seekTo(mediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition()+10000)
		ENDIF

		Create Button rewind and link to its view using findViewById method
		IF rewind button is clicked:
			//fetch the current position of the player and subtract 10 seconds from it
			Rewind video using mediaPlayer.seekTo(mediaPlayer.getCurrentPosition()-10000)

	//Override surfaceCreated(), surfaceChanged() and surfaceDestroyed() methods since SurfaceHolder.Callback is implemented.
